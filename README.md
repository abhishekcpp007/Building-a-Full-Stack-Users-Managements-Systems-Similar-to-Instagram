- Notifications: Users receive notifications for new followers, likes, and comments.
- Explore page: Users can discover new content and users through the explore page.
- Search functionality: Users can search for other users and specific posts.

## Tech Stack

Our project uses the following technologies and frameworks:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Cloud Storage: AWS S3 (optional, for storing user images)
- Deployment: Heroku (or any other preferred platform)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Building-a-Full-Stack-Users-Managements-Systems-Similar-to-Instagram.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Building-a-Full-Stack-Users-Managements-Systems-Similar-to-Instagram`

## Installation

1. Install the backend dependencies: `npm install`
2. Move to the frontend directory: `cd client`
3. Install the frontend dependencies: `npm install`
4. Return to the root directory: `cd ..`
5. Set up environment variables: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure necessary environment variables like database connection string, AWS credentials (if using AWS S3), etc.

## Usage

1. Run the backend server: `npm run dev`
2. In a separate terminal, navigate to the frontend directory: `cd client`
3. Run the frontend development server: `npm start`

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or any other specified port). From there, you can sign up as a new user or log in if you already have an account. Explore the various features such as sharing photos, following users, liking and commenting on posts, and discovering new content through the explore page.
